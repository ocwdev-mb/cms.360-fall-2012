These notes cover an outline of class activities, and descriptions of hands-on workshops. For each session, there are one or more facilitators who will lead the discussion, and one or more scribes, who will take notes and live blog the session. To learn about live blogging, check out "[How To Liveblog Events With a Team](http://mediashift.org/2012/08/how-to-live-blog-as-a-team241/)" by Matt Stempeck.

Each session should:

*   Motivate students with an intriguing question or problem.
*   Build a framework (write this down beforehand).
*   Limit the number of points (3 or 4 major ideas).
*   Move between levels of abstraction (simple/complex, abstract/concrete, familiar/unfamiliar).
