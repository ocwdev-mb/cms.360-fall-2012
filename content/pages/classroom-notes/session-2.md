The 'Crisis in Journalism' and Digital Inequalities
---------------------------------------------------

There's also a lot of talk about participatory media as a panacea for the supposed crisis. We'll ground that conversation in terms of what we know about digital inequalities.

*   In-class logistics: Confirm blog accounts, scribe plan, roles: sessionly discussion facilitators, etc. (20 min)
*   Discussion of posts (25 min)
*   Crisis in Journalism (40 min)
*   10 min break
*   40 min: Digital inequality
*   45 min: small group exercise: build a theoretical model of digital inclusion. Report back.

**Note re blog posts**: your blog post can be a comment, or a standalone post. Be sure to select the category 'Intro to Civic Media' when you create posts!

**Note re: facilitation, scribing/blog teams**: don't forget to sign up for a facilitation/scribe/blog team for a session that interests you! Do this by selecting the session's title in the Google doc and adding your name in a comment.
