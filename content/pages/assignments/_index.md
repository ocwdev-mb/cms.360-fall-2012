There are five different aspects of this course on which students will be graded.

1.  **Texts & discussion (20%):** Students are responsible for engaging with all texts for the class, and coming to all course meetings prepared to discuss the week's texts.
2.  **Weekly reflections (30%):** Expect to spend time (2-3 hours) each week on a reflection that you will post to the {{% resource_link "2f7103bb-0ef6-6b99-4167-f9c4053fcf47" "course blog" %}}.
3.  **Discussion facilitation and synthesis (10%):** Each week, a student (or pair of students, depending on class size) will be responsible for co-facilitating discussion of the assigned texts. This student (or pair) will also be responsible for synthesizing that week's texts, blog posts, and discussion notes into a single topical post for the [Center for Civic Media blog](http://civic.mit.edu/blog).
4.  **Midterm project proposal (10%):** At the semester's midpoint, each student (or group) will present a final project proposal and work plan for feedback from the rest of the students and instructor.
5.  **Final project & presentation (30%):** {{% resource_link "2344fcea-f07d-68a5-284d-387d04395fac" "The final project for Introduction to Civic Media" %}} is flexible, but is expected to be a significant original work that reflects both your understanding of the topics and texts covered in the course as well as your own ideas.
