The final project for Introduction to Civic Media is flexible, but is expected to be a significant original work that reflects both your understanding of the topics and texts covered in the course as well as your own ideas. Final projects may be completed individually or in groups, and may take the form of a case study (with a significant written component), an investment of time in civic media practice, with a substantial written reflection on that practice, or a Civic Media demo design accompanied by an analytical paper. Demo design (of games, applications, platforms, tools) may be a core component of the final project, but must also be linked to a written project paper that goes beyond description or documentation to place the demo in (theoretical, historical, and/or comparative) context.

Final project summaries and links will be posted to the C4 blog.

A complete final project includes the following:

*   A blog post summarizing the project has been published at civic.mit.edu
*   Any multimedia elements of the project have been published online and are embedded in or linked from the blog post
*   The final version of the project text has been sent to schock AT mit.edu in either an open document format or as a pdf. This should also be uploaded somewhere (to the blog, scribd, book, etc.) and linked from the blog post.

In session 4, project proposals will be due. Come up with 3 short project proposal ideas (one to three sentences each) and add them to. You can also write '+1' or your initials next to proposal ideas that you think are especially interesting and would consider joining for a group project.

During the last class meeting, each student (or project team) will formally present their final project as an [IGNITE talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)) (5 minutes, 20 slides, 15 seconds per slide, automatically advanced. Final projects are due on this date. Late projects will not be considered.

When developing final projects, consider the following theories, frames, platforms, geographic contexts, and uses of Civic Media:

*   Theoretical approaches to Civic Media: political economy, public sphere & networked publics, hegemony & resistance, identity formation.
*   Theories of social change and uses of civic media (dialogic, contentious, hacktivist.)
*   Frames: civic media, citizen journalism, media justice, public media, radical media
*   Platforms: print, radio, TV, internet, mobile, games, maps, music, theater, posters & murals, etc... Also consider cross-platform and transmedia approaches.
*   Geographic Contexts: hyperlocal & neighborhood news, city, nation state, regional & transnational, global.

Other potential themes:

*   Free software / free culture / networked commons
*   Additional reports from Knight
*   Selections from Center for Media Justice reports
*   Selections from Berkman reports
*   Selections from New America Foundation reports
